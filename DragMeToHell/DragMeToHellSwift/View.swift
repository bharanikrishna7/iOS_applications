/** BUGS:
  * - This code might fail to work when we want the number of obstacles to be large
  *   This is because the possible position of other obstacles are eveluated using 
  *   the obstacle cells (which previously satisfied the condition) in this list. If
  *   these previous obstacles are placed unfavourably then it'll be impossible to find
  *   a cell which satisfies the condition.
  *  
  *   But since this does not impact the current application requirements so it should
  *   not cause an issue. Just a heads-up for someone who wants to reuse this code.
